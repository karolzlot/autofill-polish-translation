    Some things to keep in mind while you're translating:
    Whenever you see the word "Autofill" capitalized (e.g., "Autofill Options"), then it is being used as the extension name and should not be translated.
    Please preserve all punctuations in your translation. For example, if the English text ends in a period, then the translated text should also end in a period or equivalent punctuation mark.
    You can leave out <u> and </u> in your translation since the translated text may not contain the same letters. The <u> tag underlines the letter to give a hint to the user that a keyboard shortcut is available.
    All other HTML code should be preserved. Here's a summary of what they mean:
    <ul></ul> - starts/ends a bulleted list
    <li></li> - starts/ends a bulleted list item
    <tt></tt> and <code></code> - displays the text in monospace (fixed-width) font
    <a href="URL">Link Text</a> - creates a hyperlink
    &#8212; - em dash (—)
    &quot; - double quote (")
    &hellip; - ellipsis (…)
    Do not change $1 or $2 since these are variables that will be replaced internally with the appropriate values.
    Do not change \"___\" in statusRuleMoved since this will be replaced internally with the proper profile name.
